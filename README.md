# Flux-CatVTON Empowered Commercial-Grade Haute Couture Generation: Multimodal Closed-Loop Optimization with DeepSeek-Janus
This design focuses on evening gown and haute couture presentation scenarios, proposing a commercially-oriented multimodal collaborative end-to-end generation framework. We construct a closed-loop optimization system integrating multimodal and multi-model collaboration: guided by prompt engineering, DeepSeek-R1 enables precise expression from inspirational elements to design concepts, and from scene descriptions to model expressions; utilizing the Fill model (local repainting and image extension) and Redux adapter (image variation and style transfer) within the FLUX.1 model ecosystem, combined with a cascaded generation mechanism formed by the In-Context-LoRA contextual generation model, ensures subject generation consistency; leveraging Janus-Pro-7B's cross-modal understanding capabilities integrated with Segment Anything Model(SAM) image segmentation technology achieves iterative refinement of garment details; The comprehensive solution extensively employs FLUX.1-Turbo-Alpha for accelerated diffusion generation at multiple stages, integrated with CatVTON's processed outputs to achieve high-efficiency and high-precision visual transformation.
